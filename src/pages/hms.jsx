                                Rwanda is rapidly advancing in digital transformation to boost efficiency, productivity, and customer satisfaction in the private sector, including tourism and hospitality. Despite having over 1,000 accommodation providers, less than 20% currently use digital tools to improve operations. This gap presents a huge opportunity: empowering the remaining 80% with the right technology can improve guest experiences and support the national VISIT RWANDA vision.
