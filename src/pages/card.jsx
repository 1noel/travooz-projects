                                Rwanda is rapidly becoming a digital,
                                cashless economy, boosting efficiency and
                                transparency. Yet international visitors often
                                struggle to make local payments where Visa
                                and Mastercard are not accepted, especially
                                with small vendors, artisans, and transport
                                operators. Organizations also face challenges
                                managing employee travel expenses due to
                                inefficient cash-based systems and limited
                                oversight.
